# Breadth-first-Searching-Tree-Virtual-Network-Embedding
    Network virtualization is recognized as an enabling technology for the future Internet. It aims to overcome the resistance of the 
current Internet to architectural change. Application of this technology relies on algorithms that can instantiate virtualized networks on 
a substrate infrastructure, optimizing the layout for service-relevant metrics. This class of algorithms is commonly known as “Virtual 
Network Embedding (VNE)” algorithms. In my project, my work is to do a survey of current research in the VNE algorithms and implement two of
the algorithms into Java code and do some optimization. The Algorithms are called BFSN VNE Algorithms based on the Breadth-First Searching 
Tree technique and embed virtual networks on best-fit sub-substrate networks.
